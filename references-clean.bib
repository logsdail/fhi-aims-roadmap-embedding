The latter were obtained by (partly) modifying bases developed previously. A large set of more than 300 molecules representing (nearly) all elements-except lanthanides-in their common oxidation states was used to assess the quality of the bases all across the periodic table. Quantities investigated were atomization energies{,} dipole moments and structure parameters for Hartree-Fock{,} density functional theory and correlated methods{,} for which we had chosen Moller-Plesset perturbation theory as an example. Finally recommendations are given which type of basis set is used best for a certain level of theory and a desired quality of results.},

The most time-consuming step in creating these interatomic potentials is typically the generation of a suitable training database. To aid this process hyperactive learning (HAL), an accelerated active learning scheme, is presented as a method for rapid automated training database assembly. HAL adds a biasing term to a physically motivated sampler (e.g. molecular dynamics) driving atomic structures towards uncertainty in turn generating unseen or valuable training configurations. The proposed HAL framework is used to develop atomic cluster expansion (ACE) interatomic potentials for the AlSi10 alloy and polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer starting from roughly a dozen initial configurations. The HAL generated ACE potentials are shown to be able to determine macroscopic properties, such as melting temperature and density, with close to experimental accuracy.},

Recently, symbolic regression has become an increasingly popular tool for explainable AI because it yields models that are relatively simple analytical descriptions of target properties. Due to its deterministic nature, the sure-independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) method is a particularly promising approach for this application. Here, we describe the new advancements of the SISSO algorithm, as implemented into SISSO++, a C++ code with Python bindings. We introduce a new representation of the mathematical expressions found by SISSO. This is a first step toward introducing “grammar” rules into the feature creation step. Importantly, by introducing a controlled nonlinear optimization to the feature creation step, we expand the range of possible descriptors found by the methodology. Finally, we introduce refinements to the solver algorithms for both regression and classification, which drastically increase the reliability and efficiency of SISSO. For all these improvements to the basic SISSO algorithm, we not only illustrate their potential impact but also fully detail how they operate both mathematically and computationally.}",

abstract  ="The combination of modern machine learning (ML) approaches with high-quality data from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations can yield models with an unrivalled accuracy/cost ratio. However{,} such methods are ultimately limited by the computational effort required to produce the reference data. In particular{,} reference calculations for periodic systems with many atoms can become prohibitively expensive for higher levels of theory. This trade-off is critical in the context of organic crystal structure prediction (CSP). Here{,} a data-efficient ML approach would be highly desirable{,} since screening a huge space of possible polymorphs in a narrow energy range requires the assessment of a large number of trial structures with high accuracy. In this contribution{,} we present tailored Δ-ML models that allow screening a wide range of crystal candidates while adequately describing the subtle interplay between intermolecular interactions such as H-bonding and many-body dispersion effects. This is achieved by enhancing a physics-based description of long-range interactions at the density functional tight binding (DFTB) level—for which an efficient implementation is available—with a short-range ML model trained on high-quality first-principles reference data. The presented workflow is broadly applicable to different molecular materials{,} without the need for a single periodic calculation at the reference level of theory. We show that this even allows the use of wavefunction methods in CSP."}

abstract={The adsorption energies of molecular adsorbates on catalyst surfaces are key descriptors in computational catalysis research. For the relatively large reaction intermediates frequently encountered, e.g., in syngas conversion, a multitude of possible binding motifs leads to complex potential energy surfaces (PES), however. This implies that finding the optimal structure is a difficult global optimization problem, which leads to significant uncertainty about the stability of many intermediates. To tackle this issue, we present a global optimization protocol for surface adsorbate geometries which trains a surrogate machine learning potential on-the-fly. The approach is applicable to arbitrary surface models and adsorbates and minimizes both human intervention and the number of required DFT calculations by iteratively updating the training set with configurations explored by the algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency of this approach for a diverse set of adsorbates on the Rh(111) and (211) surfaces.},

To handle the sheer number of individual calculations that are needed in such studies, workflow management packages for atomistic simulations have been developed for a rapidly growing user base. These packages are predominantly designed to handle computationally heavy ab initio calculations, usually with a focus on data provenance and reproducibility. However, in related simulation communities, e.g., the developers of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), the computational requirements are somewhat different: the types, sizes, and numbers of computational tasks are more diverse and, therefore, require additional ways of parallelization and local or remote execution for optimal efficiency. In this work, we present the atomistic simulation and MLIP fitting workflow management package wfl and Python remote execution package ExPyRe to meet these requirements. With wfl and ExPyRe, versatile atomic simulation environment based workflows that perform diverse procedures can be written. This capability is based on a low-level developer-oriented framework, which can be utilized to construct high level functionality for user-friendly programs. Such high level capabilities to automate machine learning interatomic potential fitting procedures are already incorporated in wfl, which we use to showcase its capabilities in this work. We believe that wfl fills an important niche in several growing simulation communities and will aid the development of efficient custom computational tasks.}",

In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

In this approach the velocities of all the particles are rescaled by a properly chosen random factor. The algorithm is formally justified and it is shown that, in spite of its stochastic nature, a quantity can still be defined that remains constant during the evolution. In numerical applications this quantity can be used to measure the accuracy of the sampling. The authors illustrate the properties of this new method on Lennard-Jones and TIP4P water models in the solid and liquid phases. Its performance is excellent and largely independent of the thermostat parameter also with regard to the dynamic properties. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.}},

Since the equations of motion are linear in nature, it is easy to predict the response of a Hamiltonian system to such a thermostat and to tune at will the relaxation time of modes of different frequency. This allows one to optimize the time needed for equilibration and to generate independent configurations. We show how this frequency-dependent response can be exploited to control the temperature of Car-Parrinello-like dynamics without affecting the adiabatic separation of the electronic degrees of freedom from the vibrations of the ions.}},

abstract = {We review recent theoretical and computational developments in time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) for periodic insulators and semiconductors. To capture excitonic effects within a linear-response TDDFT framework requires using exchange–correlation (xc) kernels with a proper long-range behavior, which can be efficiently modeled with a class of so-called long-range corrected xc kernels. While attractive from a computational standpoint, these xc kernels have their limitations and require judicious use. We review the pros and cons of various xc kernels in the literature, and discuss an empirical scaling approach to obtain accurate exciton binding energies with TDDFT. We also discuss generalized TDDFT approaches for excitons using hybrid functionals.}

In this work, we present an overview of the TREXIO file format and library. The library consists of a front-end implemented in the C programming language and two different back-ends: a text back-end and a binary back-end utilizing the HDF5 library which enables fast read and write operations. It is compatible with a variety of platforms and has interfaces for the Fortran, Python, and OCaml programming languages. In addition, a suite of tools has been developed to facilitate the use of the TREXIO format and library, including converters for popular quantum chemistry codes and utilities for validating and manipulating data stored in TREXIO files. The simplicity, versatility, and ease of use of TREXIO make it a valuable resource for researchers working with quantum chemistry data.},

  abstract = {Quantum chemistry is a discipline which relies heavily on very expensive numerical computations. The scaling of correlated wave function methods lies, in their standard implementation, between 6(N5) and 6(eN), where N is proportional to the system size. Therefore, performing accurate calculations on chemically meaningful systems requires (i) approximations that can lower the computational scaling and (ii) efficient implementations that take advantage of modern massively parallel architectures. QUANTUM PACKAGE is an open-source programming environment for quantum chemistry specially designed for wave function methods. Its main goal is the development of determinant-driven selected configuration interaction (sCI) methods and multireference second-order perturbation theory (PT2). The determinant-driven framework allows the programmer to include any arbitrary set of determinants in the reference space, hence providing greater methodological freedom. The sCI method implemented in QUANTUM PACKAGE is based on the CIPSI (Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively) algorithm which complements the variational sCI energy with a PT2 correction. Additional external plugins have been recently added to perform calculations with multireference coupled cluster theory and range-separated density-functional theory. All the programs are developed with the IRPF90 code generator, which simplifies collaborative work and the development of new features. QUANTUM PACKAGE strives to allow easy implementation and experimentation of new methods, while making parallel computation as simple and efficient as possible on modern supercomputer architectures. Currently, the code enables, routinely, to realize runs on roughly 2 000 CPU cores, with tens of millions of determinants in the reference space. Moreover, we have been able to push up to 12 288 cores in order to test its parallel efficiency. In the present manuscript, we also introduce some key new developments: (i) a renormalized second-order perturbative correction for efficient extrapolation to the full CI limit and (ii) a stochastic version of the CIPSI selection performed simultaneously to the PT2 calculation at no extra cost.},

  abstract = {We present NECI, a state-of-the-art implementation of the Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) algorithm, a method based on a stochastic application of the Hamiltonian matrix on a sparse sampling of the wave function. The program utilizes a very powerful parallelization and scales efficiently to more than 24 000 central processing unit cores. In this paper, we describe the core functionalities of NECI and its recent developments. This includes the capabilities to calculate ground and excited state energies, properties via the one- and two-body reduced density matrices, as well as spectral and Green’s functions for ab initio and model systems. A number of enhancements of the bare FCIQMC algorithm are available within NECI, allowing us to use a partially deterministic formulation of the algorithm, working in a spin-adapted basis or supporting transcorrelated Hamiltonians. NECI supports the FCIDUMP file format for integrals, supplying a convenient interface to numerous quantum chemistry programs, and it is licensed under GPL-3.0.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Various strategies to implement efficiently quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations for large chemical systems are presented. These include: (i) the introduction of an efficient algorithm to calculate the computationally expensive Slater matrices. This novel scheme is based on the use of the highly localized character of               atomic               Gaussian basis functions (not the               molecular               orbitals as usually done), (ii) the possibility of keeping the memory footprint minimal, (iii) the important enhancement of single‐core performance when efficient optimization tools are used, and (iv) the definition of a universal, dynamic, fault‐tolerant, and load‐balanced framework adapted to all kinds of computational platforms (massively parallel machines, clusters, or distributed grids). These strategies have been implemented in the QMC=Chem code developed at Toulouse and illustrated with numerical applications on small peptides of increasing sizes (158, 434, 1056, and 1731 electrons). Using 10–80 k computing cores of the Curie machine (GENCI‐TGCC‐CEA, France), QMC=Chem has been shown to be capable of running at the petascale level, thus demonstrating that for this machine a large part of the peak performance can be achieved. Implementation of large‐scale QMC simulations for future exascale platforms with a comparable level of efficiency is expected to be feasible. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

A model-independent analysis which combines data from all three experimental methods is applied to these elements and is presented as an illustration of the improved accuracy for the rms radii and Barrett radii which result from this analysis.}
